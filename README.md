## Compilation Instructions

For much of the reference material included in this repository, it helps to be able to run code on your own machine. This section includes some instructions for compiling your c files on whatever machine you may be using.

#### <ins>Mac/OSX</ins>

This tutorial explains in-depth with visuals the ```gcc``` installation process: https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=check+if+gcc+is+installed+mac&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8

#### <ins>Linux</ins>

Very simple tutorial here: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gcc-compiler-on-ubuntu-18-04/

#### <ins>Windows</ins>

## IDE Recommendations

A lot of people have asked me what my preferred code editing software is. The straight answer is, it depends on factors such as:
- What is the size and scale of the project I'm working on?
- Are others collaborating on the project with me?
- Do I need built-in testing / testing on-the-fly?
- What operating system am I coding on / target production for?

Of course, there's situational dependence, but ultimately go with what you're used to! I'll make a few recommendations, but take with a grain of salt:

- ```Notepad++```: Perfect for small, single-file edits, or quick on the fly changes. Windows only.
- ```Sublime Text```: Also great for small changes, but wouldn't recommend for a project that goes bigger than a few files.
- ```Vim```: Great for editing right within the terminal or console window, and a must-know for any programmers / pen-testers that may have to modify scripts over an SSH connection. Has a steep learning curve.
- ```VSCode```: Fanastic all-around code editor with lots of built-in capabitilies. Can feel like overkill for small file edits and single-file projects.
- ```Atom```: Don't have much experience with Atom, but from what I've seen so far it seems great. Looks sleek and flexible.

Of course there are many other code editors out there, so use the one that's right for you... and your project!
